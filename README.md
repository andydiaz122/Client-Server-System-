# Client-Server-System-
A client-server system that implements a fault-tolerant networking file system using redundancy 
The design emulates a linux file system where the client software interfaces with 4 servers such that if one of the servers goes down, the client can fetch data from another server using redundancy. The client provides an interactive window to the user with the capabilities to do the following file system commands: mkdir, create, mv, read, write, status, rm
